This thesis project is a sub­project of project TACK[1], which is an ongoing researchproject carried out by KTH ­ Royal Institute of Technology, Sapienza University ofRome and WSP Sweden company under the InfraSweden2030 program funded byVinnova. The main objective of TACK is developing a methodology for automaticdetection and measurement of cracks on tunnel linings or other infrastructures. Inthis thesis project, a deep­learning approach is used to automatically detect cracks inthe images acquired by a mobile mapping system.
